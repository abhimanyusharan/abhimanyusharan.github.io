						<li>In the Spring semester (Jan-May 2022), I had completed a project titled <span class="bold italic">Simplifying the Integral Analysis of An

							This was implemented using the FVM techniques learnt in the class and was executed on MATLAB using the explicit Euler time-advancement method.</li>
						<li>Another spring term project that I executed was for a course titled <span class="italic">Mechatronics</span>. This was a fun team project where the

                        <li>This is done by doing an Ergonomic Workplace Assessment for the users by analysing their workplace
                            setups and how they interact with their systems. This analysis is followed by identification of risk factors
                            and recommendations on how to deal with them. All these steps are documented as a detailed report and
                            shared with the user.</li>

                        <li>I have also completed an ergonomic walk-through of a food manufacturing plant remotely. This involved
                            interviewing the supervisor to understand the work processes of different sections of the plant,

					<ul>
						<li>The aim of the project was to analyse a three-fluid heat exchanger using Galerkin's
							finite element method in terms of effectiveness-number of transfer units plots.</li>
						<li>It was initially done for 4 different arrangements of 3-fluid cross-flow heat exchangers
							and the one showing the best results was considered for further investigation.</li>
						<li>The considered exchanger was then optimized for a given set of fluid parameters to determine
						 	the optimal dimensions for high effectiveness and low pressure drop. This was done using
							Genetic Algorithhm and using Particle Swarm Optimization.
							This has been published in a journal as follows-

						<li>Further analysis was carried out for the heat exchanger by including other effects such as
							heat interaction with the surroundings and heat loss due to conduction in the seperating walls
							of the heat exchanger. I have presented this at a conference called THERMACOMP-2018,
							which was held at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
