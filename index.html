					taking up Dr. Charles Severence's beginner level specialization on Coursera named
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for Everybody</a>
					consisting of five courses. As an add-on to explore the various applications of Python,
					I did two other specializations - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python">
					Applied Data Science with Python</a> by Dr. Christopher Brooks and co on Coursera, and
					Django for Everbody by Dr. Charles on a site which he developed for the course -
					<a href="http://www.dj4e.com/">DJ4E</a>.
					<p/>
					Skills Acquired: Python, pandas, numpy, data visualization, web scraping, machine learning,
					text mining, network analysis, basic SQL, web design, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django framework

					This wonderfully designed course by Andrew Ng had allowed me to combine and scale
					my basic knowledge of mathematics, statistics, Linear Algebra and vector calculus
					coupled with MATLAB programming. It has allowed me to learn the different aspects
					of Machine Learning, beginning from the definition, the classification, the algorithms,
					and product development. It was a fun experience attending these lectures and solving
					the challenging assignments. I scored an overall grade of 95.7%.<p/>
					Algorithms covered: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks
