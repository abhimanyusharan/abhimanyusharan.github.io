				<div class="intro">Final Year B.Tech Project</div>
				<div class="content">
					<ul>
						<li>The aim of the project was to analyse a three-fluid heat exchanger using Galerkin's
							finite element method in terms of effectiveness-number of transfer units plots.</li>
						<li>It was initially done for 4 different arrangements of 3-fluid cross-flow heat exchangers
							and the one showing the best results was considered for further investigation.</li>
						<li>The considered exchanger was then optimized for a given set of fluid parameters to determine
						 	the optimal dimensions for high effectiveness and low pressure drop. This was done using
							Genetic Algorithhm and using Particle Swarm Optimization.
							This has been published in a journal as follows-

								https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsep.2019.04.009</a></span></li>
						<li>Further analysis was carried out for the heat exchanger by including other effects such as
							heat interaction with the surroundings and heat loss due to conduction in the seperating walls
							of the heat exchanger. I have presented this at a conference called THERMACOMP-2018,
							which was held at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
							The proceedings can be seen
